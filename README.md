# image-captioning
### Final Project for  "Introduction to Deep Learning (CSCIS-89)" course at Harvard Summer School 2021

I implemented [code](https://github.com/nikolo555/image-captioning/blob/main/image-captioning-CODE.ipynb) for *Image Captioning*, which refers to generating a textual description of a given image. For the experiments, I used resources from Google Colaboratory and developed deep learning models using the Keras library.

The [report](https://github.com/nikolo555/image-captioning/blob/main/image-captioning-REPORT.pdf) is a documentation that includes full instructions for configuration, importing datasets, buildingÂ and training the model.

I also made a [video tutorial]( https://youtu.be/_sICLj7h6cI) explaining the code step by step.
